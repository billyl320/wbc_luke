# Classification of White Blood Cell Lerkemia with Low Number of Interpretable and Explainable Features
White Blood Cell Leukaemia is still challenging area of research where using images to detect malignant cells are vital.  The state of the art approach is to use a form of a Convolutional Neural Network to learn the features needed to classify images.  However, this type of model requires learning a large number of features and are difficult at best to interpret and explain.  We present a model which uses only 24 interpretable and explainable features and is highly competitive to the state of the art.  Further, our approach provides insight into which variables are the most important for the classification of the cells.  Our approach is applied to two publicly available datasets and achieve very competitive results.  We expect that using a small number of interpretable and explainable features can be used alongside machine learning algorithms to produce competitive and useful models for image classification problems.  Our approach outperforms the state of the art by about 3.85%.  This is particularly important in medical imaging diagnosis where understanding what features are important for classification are important.
